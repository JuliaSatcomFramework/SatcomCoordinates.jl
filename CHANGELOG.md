### Changed
- Compared to the implementation in ReferenceViews.jl v0.2.0, most pointing and cartesian coordinates are now storing internally Unitful quantities, and structures are made parametric with respect to the number type of the fields.
- The `ThetaPhi` pointing type is now now _wrapping_ the values provided at its input, with Theta always being between 0째 and 90째 and Phi always between -180째 and 180째.
